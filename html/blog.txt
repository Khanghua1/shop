<p id="tt1">Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important 
holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however,
 Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning 
 marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day
  of the last Lunar month is East Dayâ€”a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year 
  on this day.<p>
